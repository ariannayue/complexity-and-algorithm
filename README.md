Run Time:

The time module:
from timeit import defaul_timer as timer
start_timer = timer() #variable holds the start time
#processing
end_timer = timer()
run_time = end_timer - start_timer 

Refactoring:
unit: segment of program that handles a problem's specific requirement
Refactoring: Improving the performance and efficiency of the unit withou affecting input and output of the unit
- can be used to omptimize the processing section
